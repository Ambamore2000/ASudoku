# ASudoku
A working sudoku game. Inspired by my failure to create a functional sudoku game for my AP Computer Science Principles class in high school. https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/3z2ZUpnpJW0L8lYo17SlW5bLgNwSypopALcIqKZbg8A. What a joke honestly lol

Having given up trying to create an algorithm on my own, I've done some research to find out that it's a lot more Fucking difficult than I thought it would be to make a winning Sudoku board.

After many failed attempts to make a generated board, I've stumbled upon what I believe to be the answer to my solution.
My final attempt here is to make a recursive backtracking algorithm very similar to that of the website (Hopefully without looking at the algorithm at all).
Hope I don't break my laptop working on this. Cheers to future me if I get this. I'm genuinely going to be so happy if I do.
